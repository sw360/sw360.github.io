        <h1>What is that all about</h1>

          <p>
              In most cases, software today is not built from scratch, but rather assembled from various prepackaged third-party software components.
              As a result, organizations face the following challenges:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Verifying various aspects of compliance when using third-party software components: license compliance, ECC checks, IP assessments, etc.</li>
              <li>Sharing knowledge about software components and their qualities. For example, which software components should be recommended, which should be phased out based on which criteria?</li>
              <li>Providing a broad overview of the components used: An organization and its supply chain management must have information about which assets are integrated into which products or solutions.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
              These three main use cases target different roles in an organization:
              quality managers, software developers, legal counsels, software architects, R&D managers etc.
              However, all these use cases share a common need for a central hub that manages insights into software components.
          </p>

          <p>
              SW360 is an open source software project licensed under the EPL-1.0 that provides both a web application and a repository to collect,
              organize and make available information about software components. It establishes a central hub for software components in an organization. SW360 allows for
          </p>

          <ul>
              <li>tracking components used by a project/product,</li>
              <li>assessing security vulnerabilities,</li>
              <li>maintaining license obligations,</li>
              <li>enforcing policies, and</li>
              <li>generating legal documents.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
              For example, SW360 can trigger a clearing process in the open source compliance tool FOSSology and import the resulting clearing reporting.
              Data is either stored in SW360â€™s database or on the fly imported from external sources. In future we plan to have federations of
              SW360 instances that share selected information. Besides its web-based UI, all functionality of SW360 is available through an API that allows an
              integration into existing devops tools.
          </p>
